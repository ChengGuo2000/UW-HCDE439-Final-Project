            <h4>Project Concept & Motivation</h4>
            <p>
                I would like to build a multifunctional companion robot that emotionally supports people at work. 
                The final product of my project is similar to what is presented here:

            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>
                As programmers, we often code on a computer for a long time alone in our office.
                We need some emotional support so that we no longer feel lonely. 
                We also need some fidget toys to release our stress. 
                So, I designed this emotional support robot that we can put on the side of our table
                and enjoying its company while we spend time alone.

                I hope that whenever an programmer needs support, they can quickly turn on the robot
                by connect it to a battery. To support the programmer emotionally, I thought of human's interaction with pets.
                We usually petting them on their head, and gently stroke their fur for enjoyment.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>LCD: display messages response to user's behavior</li>
                <li>Photoresistor: detecting user's petting</li>
                <li>Joystick: as a fidget toy control</li>
                <li>Ultrasonic sensor: not functional in the robot, just mimicking the eyes</li>
            </ol>
