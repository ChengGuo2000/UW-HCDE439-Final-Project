            <p>
                This is my code for the Blink assignment.
                Each LED each blinks for a quarter second in the sequence of red, green, and blue,
                then all of them blink for a quarter second.
                There are a quarter second delay between all blinks. The entire process loops.

                My Calculation: Why did I pick these values for the resistors?
            </h3>
            <p>
                I choose to use red, green, and blue LEDs and put them in parallel.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the red and green LEDs, they both have a 1.8V drop. 5V - 1.8V = 3.2V and 3.2V / 20mA = 160Ω. 
                To not have the current flow through the those two over 20mA, the resistence should be greater than 160Ω.
                But I want the resistence to be as small as possible. So I used 220Ω resistors for the red and green LEDs.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the blue LED, it has a 3.3V drop. 5V - 3.3V = 1.7V and 1.7V / 20mA = 85Ω. 
                To not have the current flow through the those two over 20mA, the resistence should be greater than 85Ω.
                But I want the resistence to be as small as possible. So I used 100Ω resistors for the blue LED.
