                This is my code for the Fade assignment.
                The blue LED blinks for a quarter second then turns off for a quarter second.
                The green LED slowly turns on for a quarter second then slowly turns off for a quarter second.
                The red LED keeps turning on, while it fades when pressing the push button

                My Calculation: Why did I pick these values for the resistors?
            </h3>
            <p>
                I choose to use red, green, and blue LEDs and put them in parallel.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the red and green LEDs, they both have a 1.8V drop. 5V - 1.8V = 3.2V and 3.2V / 20mA = 160Ω. 
                To not have the current flow through the those two over 20mA, the resistence should be greater than 160Ω.
                But I want the resistence to be as small as possible. So I used 220Ω resistors for the red and green LEDs.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the blue LED, it has a 3.3V drop. 5V - 3.3V = 1.7V and 1.7V / 20mA = 85Ω. 
                To not have the current flow through the those two over 20mA, the resistence should be greater than 85Ω.
                But I want the resistence to be as small as possible. So I used 100Ω resistors for the blue LED.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the push button, it does not have any resistence. While I do not want any short circuit if I turn it on,
                So I choosed a 10KΩ resistor because it will make ensure no short circuits.
